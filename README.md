# Balloon Battle Repository

Balloon Battle is my first attempt at creating an original game. After following tutorials and making clones of retro 2D arcade games, I wanted to see how far I could get on my own. Still, I continued to utilize resources such as Microsoft and Unity documentation and a few forums to answer questions. Quickly becoming obsessed with more features and design choices, the project has grown and become more complicated than originaly planned for.

Since establishing 50 levels for the player to attempt, I've taken a step back from building more into the game and the primary goal has become optimization. It is clear the code is far from perfect, but I have made note of several changes that will hopefully improve performance on other machines. Primarily, applying force to objects in functions called from Update() is a major mistake that has yet to be addressed. Because of this improper physics handling (and almost certainly other issues I have yet to recognize), the game drags and crashes if it cannot be maintained at outragously high frame rates.
